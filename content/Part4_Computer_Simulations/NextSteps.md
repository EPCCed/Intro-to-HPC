# Next steps

You have now covered the material in the course where should you go from here?
## Case studies

ARCHER2 has a number of cases studies https://www.archer2.ac.uk/research/case-studies/

These examples cover how ARCHER2 is used to predict:

- Flow within and around a large wind farm
- Coral reef connectivity in the sothwestern Indian Ocean
- Predicting airborne pathogen spread
- Forecasting the dispersion of volcanic ash and gas
- Predicting aircraft jet noise
- Improving cloud modeling for better weather and climate


## Webinars 

One way to learn more about the ARCHER2 service and the type of research that is conducted on the ARCHER2 system is to attend our webinars.
These are usually on a wednesday afternoon, more information can be found on our website [here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/materials/webinars).

Previous webinar topics have included talks on debuggers, profilers, how to maximise the performance of the system and a variety of talks on the outcomes of eCSE projects that discuss specific science codes and results.

The webinars are published to the ARCHER2 [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@archer2hpc596/videos) channel so you can review previous webinars to get a better idea of what work is being done on the system. 

Addtionally if you have some interesting work using the system we are always open to people looking to give talks on how the ARCHER2 system has benefited their research. If you have a topic you would like to speak on please contact us via email, support@archer2.ac.uk.

## Additional Training

While this course has focused on an introduction to the high performance computing there are a number of additional courses avalible to improve skills and increase your experiance with high performance computing.

From the EPCC there are:

- Course overviews [here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/)
- Course pathways [here](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/courses/course-paths)

A number of these course are avalible to work through at your lesuire via the online [training repository](https://www.archer2.ac.uk/training/materials/) and the video's of these training sessions are also posted to the ARCHER2 [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/@archer2hpc596/videos) channel.

The EuroCC project has put in considerable effort to create a database of courses from across Europe that can be found [here](https://www.eurocc-access.eu/services/training/). This resource can be particularly beneficial if you are looking for a course on a particular HPC system across Europe or in another language.
