# Practical exercise 2: Parallel worksharing, Fractal code

In this practical exercise you will:

-  Compile and run MPI code.
-  Investigate parallel task farms and work sharing.

The case study code for this exercise is a program which calculates the Mandelbrot and Julia sets. The source code can be found on this [Github repository](https://github.com/EPCCed/EPCC-Exercises).
