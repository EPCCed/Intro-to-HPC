## Traffic model simulation: Message passing computation

Having run this example in serial and multiple threads we can now explore running the simulation using a message passing modle to determine verlocity of cars changes with traffic density.









## Conclusion

- The simulation bares out a plot of what we expected that as te traffic density increases the speed of the traffic drops.
