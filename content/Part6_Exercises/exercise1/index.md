# Practical exercise 1: First use of HPC machine, Image sharpening code

In this practical exercise you will:

-   Access {{ machine_name }} using SSH.
-   Become familiar with linux and the command line.
-   Compile and run serial code interactively.
-   Submit serial and parallel programs to run using the batch system.
