# Practical exercise 1: First use of HPC machine, Image sharpening code. This might work well after the 'Parallel Computing' section.

In this practical exercise you will:

-   Access {{ machine_name }} using SSH.
-   Become familiar with linux and the command line.
-   Compile and run serial code interactively.
-   Submit serial and parallel programs to run using the batch system.

The case study code for this exercise is a image sharpening program. The source code we will use is on this [Github repository](https://github.com/EPCCed/EPCC-Exercises).
