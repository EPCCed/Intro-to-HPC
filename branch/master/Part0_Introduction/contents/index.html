<p class="admonition-title">Transcript</p>
<p>0:12 - Welcome to the Supercomputing MOOC. My name is David Henty, and I work at EPCC, the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre at the University of Edinburgh in Scotland. We run the UK National Supercomputer Service, ARCHER, and it’s used by a wide range of scientists and engineers across the United Kingdom. ARCHER is also part of the European PRACE research infrastructure, which is a pan-Europeon network of supercomputers, and this whole course has been developed as part of PRACE.</p>
<p>0:43 - Today’s supercomputers are the largest and most powerful calculating machines ever constructed. Costing tens of millions of euros to build and consuming millions of euros of electricity per year. But how are they constructed? Where do they get their enormous computing power from? Are they similar to your home laptop or completely different? How can we use all that computational power to solve real problems? What real-world applications do supercomputers have? Over the next five weeks, we’re going to help you understand what supercomputing is. And although we’ll use some particular supercomputers as specific examples, we’ll try and cover most things at a conceptual level, so you understand the fundamental principles and challenges involved.</p>
<p>1:27 - In this course, we have four main aims, to give you some sense of the excitement of working at the leading edge of computing technology, to demystify the technical jargon and explain how supercomputers are built and how they are programmed, to show you how useful they are and the central role they play in modern science and engineering, and to explain how real-world problems such as weather forecasting can be expressed in a way that can then be tackled by a modern supercomputer. Now this isn’t a programming course. Although if you do know about computer programming, you’ll be able to appreciate the similarities and differences between programming your home machine and programming a parallel supercomputer.</p>
<p>2:07 - We also don’t assume any existing knowledge of computing maths or science. We just assume you’re generally interested in computing and how computers can be used to solve real-world problems. The course also aims to give you an insight into how your domestic devices, such as netbooks, laptops, and games machines, actually work. A modern mobile phone would have beaten the fastest supercomputer in the world less than 25 years ago. So where does all this power come from? What drives this seemingly relentless growth in computer technology? And what does the future hold?</p>
</div>
<p>Welcome! Meet the lead educator of the Supercomputing course by PRACE, Dr David Henty who will guide you through the course.</p>
<p>This may be the first self service course you have worked through so to help you get the best learning experience we have prepared a few tips for you. Hopefully, they will help you get the most out of the course.</p>
<p>The course material is presented as a mixture of videos, articles, exercises and quizzes. Once you have gone through a step and decided that you have familiarised yourself with its content, you can mark it as complete.</p>
<p>The course is no longer fully facilitated so we would like to encourage you to interact with others taking the course if many of you local team are working through the content. If there is anything that you find confusing, ask, and if you know an answer to a question, answer it. You will find that both asking and answering questions helps to consolidate not only your but also other people’s knowledge. And more importantly, it’s fun! So if you have an opinion share it!</p>

<p>“Within the EuroCC project under the European Union’s Horizon 2020 (H2020), participating countries are tasked with establishing a single National Competence Centre (NCC) in the area of high-performance computing (HPC) in their respective countries. These NCCs will coordinate activities in all HPC-related fields at the national level and serve as a contact point for customers from industry, science, (future) HPC experts, and the general public alike. The EuroCC project is funded 50 percent through H2020 (EuroHPC Joint Undertaking [JU]) and 50 percent through national funding programs within the partner countries.” - EuroCC Website</p>
<p>“The Coordination and Support Action (CSA) CASTIEL leads to cross-European networking activities between National Competence Centres (NCCs) in HPC-related topics addressed through the EuroCC project. CASTIEL emphasises training, industrial interaction and cooperation, business development, raising awareness of HPC-related technologies and expertise. As a hub for information exchange and training, CASTIEL promotes networking among NCCs and strengthens idea exchange by developing best practices. The identification of synergies, challenges, and possible solutions is implemented through the close cooperation of the NCCs at a European level.” - Castiel Website</p>
